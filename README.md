# lichess-berserk
always berserk / always berserk back  
use the contents of `berserk.js` in something like tampermonkey

**todo:** *(i.e. never)*
- different settings by time control and/or opponent rating  
- fully implement zerking strategies within the script, at least for personal use (e.g. more aggressive zerking out of streak)
